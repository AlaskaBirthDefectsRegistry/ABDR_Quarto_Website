Although p-value estimates are provided to assess the trend (increasing or decreasing) over time, caution should be used in interpretation as data collection methods and data aggregation may vary, leading to systematic differences over time. Reports of defects are only included if diagnosed before the age of three years. For conditions that are commonly diagnosed after the first three years of life, reporting estimates may be systematically lower.\nThe p-value estimates the probability that the observed slope is different from a slope of zero. By convention an alpha of 0.05 is used to determine significance; p-values are only calculated for defects with 3 or more data points. The p-value estimate is calculated to model the observed rates over time using a generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution and offset of the natural log (ln) of the birth population size under the form:\n\n\\[ ln \\frac a n = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\ln(n) \\]\nResources\nNational Birth Defects Prevention Network\nCenters for Diesase Control and Prevention\nContact\nAlaska Birth Defects Registry (ABDR)\n3601 C Street, Suite 358\nAnchorage, AK 99503\n(907) 269-3400 phone\n(907) 754-3529 fax\nhssbirthdefreg@alaska.gov\nUpdated: May 14, 2025\nCode source: R:\\ABDR\\Analysis_New\\Published Data\\trend07_20.Rmd"

    "text": "Anencephaly is a neural tube defect (NTD) or brain disorder that results when the upper part of the neural tube does not close all the way. The neural tube is essential in forming the infant’s brain, skull, and spinal cord. The incomplete closure of the upper part of the neural tube results in a infant being born without the forebrain (the front part of the brain) and the cerebrum (the thinking and coordinating part of the brain). The remaining brain tissue is often left exposed, uncovered by bone or skin. Affected babies are usually born unconscious, blind, deaf, and unable to feel pain. Due to the severity of this condition, almost all babies with anencephaly die before birth or only survive a few hours or days after birth. [1,2]\nMost occurrences of anencephaly are sporadic and happen in people with no family history of the condition or other NDTs. However, similar to spina bifida, another NTD, low intake of folic acid before and in early pregnancy has been shown to increase the risk of having a child affected by anencephaly.

    "text": "Epidemiology\nAlaska Birth Defects Registry (ABDR) registers birth defects as reported from health care providers using International Classification of Disease (ICD) billing codes. The use of these ICD codes can lead to misclassification of diagnosed conditions. Prior to this report, all prevalence estimates were based on the number of unique children reported to ABDR with an ICD code representing a specified condition regardless of case confirmation status.\nThe estimates in this report were derived by conducting medical record review and case confirmation of a random sample of cases of the condition reported to ABDR. The confirmation probability from the sample was used to develop informed estimates of the actual diagnosed defect prevalence. See Defect prevalence calculation.\nFor explanations of table columns see Column descriptions.\n\nPrevalence\nAnencephaly occurs in 2.15 (95% CI 2.03–2.28) out of every 10,000 live births in the United States. This results in about 860 babies diagnosed with anencephaly nationally each year.[1], [5]\nIn Alaska, during 2007-2021, the prevalence of anencephaly was 0.7 per 10,000 live births.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports\nDefects\nBirths\nPrevalence (95% CI)\n\n\n\n\n30\n11.8\n162989\n0.7 (0.4, 1.2)\n\n\n\nNotes: 95% CI = 95% Confidence Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend\nPrevalence per 10,000 births of anencephaly during 2007-2021 by five-year moving averages, with 95% confidence interval band and Poisson estimated fitted line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend tests with a p-value of 0.05 or lower detect a statistically significant increase or decrease in the number of live births with anencephaly during 2007-2021.

This model assumes the variance is a linear function of the mean and models the estimated number of annual defects by year with a natural log (ln) offset of the annual births. P-values &lt; 0.05 are considered significant, which indicates that the predicted slope is significantly different from a slope of zero.\n\n\nData suppression\nFor region and demographic data tables, values are suppressed based on the number of reports received during the observation period. Counts less than 6 are suppressed (as indicated by ‘-’ in the table). For regions or demographics with only one cell count suppressed a second is suppressed to eliminate the ability to back-calculate the estimate."
